## Communication Models
1. **Device to Device:**
   - Device-to-device communication is most commonly used in smart home devices such as thermostats, light bulbs, door locks, CCTV cameras, and fridges, which transfer small data packets to each other at a low data rate.
2. **Device to Cloud:**
   - devices communicate with the cloud directly, rather than directly communicating with the client to send or receive data or commands. It uses communication protocols such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet, and sometimes uses Cellular as well.
3. **Device to Gateway:**
   - In this model, the IoT device communicates with an intermediate device called a gateway, which in turn communicates with the cloud service.
4. **Backend Data Sharing:**
   - This type of communication model extends the device-to-cloud communication type such that the data from the IoT devices can be accessed by authorized third parties. Here, devices upload their data onto the cloud, which is later accessed or analyzed by third parties.

  - consists 3 Zones:Manufacturing zone(aka OT System, has 4 levels-0 to 3) and Enterprise Zone( aka IT System,has 2 level-4 to 5) separated by Demilitarized Zone(DMZ).
    1. OT System:
      - all the devices,networks,control and monitoring systems reside in this zone
        - level 0/Physical Process: actual physical process is defined and product is manufactured.
        - level 1/basic controls/Intelligent devices: Analyzation and alteration of physical process can be done at this level
        - level 2/Control systems/Area supervisory controls: Supervising,monitoring and controlling the physical process is carried out at this level.control systems can be DCSs,SCADA etc..
