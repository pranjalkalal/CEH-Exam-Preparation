- **ARIN:** The online service that would serve the objective of Danny, a black hat hacker, to gather information such as network topology, network range, and operating system used in the target's network is ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers). ARIN is a Regional Internet Registry that manages the distribution and registration of IP addresses and other Internet number resources in North America. It maintains a database of information about IP address assignments and other network-related information, which can be queried by users to obtain information about a target organization's network.
- **technical threat intelligence**: Technical threat intelligence is primarily used by the security team to build preventive/corrective defense. Technical threat intelligence collects information about the attacker's resources, such as command and control channels and tools used in attacks. It focuses on specific indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as IP addresses, phishing email headers, and hash checksums. This information is used to analyze attacks and to develop rules for security products like IDS/IPS, firewalls, and endpoint security systems. By using technical threat intelligence, security teams can detect and respond to attacks in a timely manner, thereby building a stronger defense against potential threats.
- Maltego is a tool used for open-source intelligence and link analysis, helping to visualize relationships between entities.
- Bettercap is a network analysis and attack tool that is written in Go language. It is used for conducting various types of security testing, including Man in the middle (MITM) attacks using ARP spoofing.
- If you send a TCP ACK segment to a known closed port on a firewall but it does not respond with an RST, and you receive no other response, it is likely that the firewall is configured to silently drop the incoming packet. This behavior is characteristic of stateful firewalls, which maintain a table of connections and only allow traffic that belongs to an established connection or meets specific criteria defined in the firewall rules. In contrast, a non-stateful firewall would typically respond with an RST packet immediately upon receiving an ACK packet to a closed port.
- The IP address listed first in the log entry is typically considered to be the client, and the IP address listed second is typically considered to be the server.
- NetBIOS codes used in enumeration
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to create a fake root bridge and redirect network traffic. The attacker can then gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or disrupt network operations.
- scans web servers for dangerous files/CGIs Explanation: Nikto is an open-source command-line vulnerability scanner that can scan web servers for dangerous files, outdated server software, and other potential security vulnerabilities.
- A stealth virus is a type of computer virus that is designed to avoid detection by antivirus software by actively hiding itself from detection.
-  Hypervisor-level rootkits are injected underneath the operating system and operate at a layer below it, called the hypervisor or virtual machine monitor. This allows the rootkit to remain hidden from the operating system and any security measures implemented within it.
-  The Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL exposes the private key of the server to the Internet, making it vulnerable
-  Sniffing through a hub can be considered as passive sniffing, as the hub broadcasts all traffic received on one port to all other ports, allowing any device connected to the hub to capture and analyze network traffic.
-  Pharming is a type of online attack where an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Domain Name System (DNS) to redirect victims to a fake website that looks like a legitimate one.
-  Evilginx is a tool used by cybercriminals to trick people into giving away their login credentials by creating fake websites that mimic legitimate ones.
-  dle scanning is a technique used for network scanning and firewall evasion. It involves using a "zombie system" - a third-party computer with low network activity - to scan a target network for open ports and vulnerabilities. Idle scanning is a stealthy technique because the traffic generated by the scan is less likely to be detected by the target network's security defenses, such as firewalls.
-  Nikto is a free and open-source web server scanner that performs comprehensive tests on web servers to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
-  A webhook is a method for receiving information automatically when an event occurs in another application. When the event occurs, the webhook sends a message to a specific URL provided by the receiving application.
