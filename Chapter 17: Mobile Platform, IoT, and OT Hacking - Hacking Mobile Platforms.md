# Mobile Security Basics

## Attack Surfaces of Mobile Devices
Mobile devices have multiple entry points for attackers due to their extensive functionality and connectivity.

### Key Attack Surfaces
1. **Operating Systems**:
   - Vulnerable to outdated patches.
   - Regular updates are essential to address security flaws.
2. **Applications**:
   - Third-party or malicious apps can exploit devices.
   - Even official app stores occasionally host compromised apps.
3. **Bluetooth**:
   - Susceptible to attacks like Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing, Bluebugging, and BlueBorne.
   - Older specifications lack encryption and authentication.
4. **Wi-Fi**:
   - Subject to common wireless threats (e.g., Evil Twin, Honeypot attacks).
   - Devices on public Wi-Fi are particularly vulnerable.
5. **Telco (Cellular Networks)**:
   - Outdated protocols like SS7 allow attackers to eavesdrop on calls, intercept messages, and perform billing fraud.
6. **Web Browsing**:
   - Exposed to client-side attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), drive-by downloads, and clickjacking.


## Threats and Vulnerabilities
### Malware
- **Overview**: Malware targets all devices, including mobile.
- **Examples**: Malicious APKs, spyware apps.
- **Prevention**: Regular updates, antivirus tools, and avoiding third-party app stores.

### SIM Hijacking
- **Mechanism**:
  - Attackers hijack SIMs to intercept 2FA messages and calls.
  - Insider threats may involve telecom employees.
- **Impact**: Compromises sensitive accounts and communication.

### App Store Threats
- **Official Stores**:
  - Even trusted platforms like Google Play and Apple App Store can host malicious apps.
- **Third-Party Stores**:
  - Apps from third-party sources like FDroid require careful vetting.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Stick to official app stores and minimize app installs.

### Encryption Weaknesses
- **Unencrypted Communication**:
  - SMS and certain apps lack encryption.
- **Weak Encryption**:
  - Devices using outdated protocols are vulnerable.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Use apps with end-to-end encryption like Signal or WhatsApp.
  - Ensure devices utilize strong encryption protocols.

### Theft and Physical Access
- **Risks**:
  - Unlocked or poorly secured devices can lead to unauthorized access.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Enable auto-lock features with strong passwords or biometrics.
